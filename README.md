# Implementation of statistical methods.

This repository is for learning purpouses. It covers from set theory to more advanced methods in statistics.

## Set Theory

- Union sets
- Intersection sets

## Statistics

- Mean (`media.cpp` and `variance.R`)
- Varianze (`variance.cpp` and `variance.R`)
- Standardization (`standardization.cpp` trough header files)
- Range
- Quartile
- Interquartile range

## Probabilty

<<<<<<< HEAD

## Inference

- sample mean
- sample variance
